= Code Valet

== Problem

The link:https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] project faces a challenge unusual to other
contemporary CI/CD tools in that it is downloaded and executed on a user's
machine(s) rather than as a service. While this offers quite a lot of
flexibility to the end-user, it puts Jenkins developers at a disadvantage for a
number of reasons:

. There is no direct return line of feedback from where their code is executed.
  No error reports, etc.
. There is a significant lag between developers releasing code and it being
  adopted/used.


== Solution

A free service which provides basic CI/CD functions with Jenkins as the core
platform. With a regularly updated "Jenkins distribution" consisting of many of
the key plugins which people are used, built from `master`, and rolled through
the Code Valet cluster:

. Blue Ocean
. GitHub Branch Source
. Pipeline
. ???
