= Groovy bootstrap scripts for Jenkins

This directory contains a number Groovy-based scripts which will execute when
the Jenkins instances boot up, providing the baseline configuration required
per instance.

== Environment Variables

The environment variables that these scripts need to be present when Jenkins
executes are:

=== GITHUB_USER

The user on link:https://github.com[github.com] who should "own" this instance.
This will automatically set up some permissions for the set `GITHUB_USER`

=== CLIENT_SECRET

The GitHub OAuth "Client Secret" for the OAuth Application which should be used
for authentication against these Jenkins instances.
