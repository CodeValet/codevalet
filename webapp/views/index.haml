      %p
        Integrating with Code Valet is easy. To get started, sign up with your GitHub 
        account, select a project to build, and define how to build it, either visually 
        or declaratively.

        How it works
      %p
        Code Valet is powered by
        %a{:href => 'https://jenkins.io'}
          Jenkins&reg; 2
        with
        %a{:href => 'https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline'}
          Jenkins Pipeline
        and
        %a{:href => 'https://jenkins.io/project/blueocean'}
          Blue Ocean
        but no prior Jenkins knowledge is required to use Code Valet.
      %p
        Code Valet uses its own regularly updated "Jenkins
        distribution" consisting of many commonly used
        %a{:href => 'https://plugins.jenkins.io'}
          plugins
        built from their "master" branches.

        Success stories
      %p
        Code Valet provides the Jenkins project with
        rapid feedback based on real-world usage of Jenkins. This means rather
        than following the Jenkins project's
        %a{:href => 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_train'}
          release-train model
        Code Valet practices a more radical
        %a{:href => 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery'}
          continuous delivery model.
      %p
        Using Code Valet ultimately helps the Jenkins community improve its support 
        for wider variety of platforms by increasing the diversity of projects built 
        by Jenkins.
